# SeaShell
- Run `make` cmd to run `makefile`.
- Use `./seashell` to initiate the shell.
- Entry point exists in `shell.c`.

# Challenges faced while making this project:
- It's been a while since playing with pointers and pointer to pointer, so had to take extra care of that.
- Got to know that `strcat` is not supported for pointers. I made `concat` to concatenate two strings pointed by pointers.
